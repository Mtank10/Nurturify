# Implementation Notes - EduAI Platform

## Overview
Converted the entire application from a Prisma/Express backend to a fully functional Supabase-based system with complete authentication and user registration.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration to Supabase
- **Created comprehensive database schema** (`supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`)
  - 25+ tables including users, students, teachers, parents, subjects, classes, assignments, etc.
  - Full mental health tracking system
  - Gamification and leaderboard systems
  - Communication and messaging infrastructure
  - Complete Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
  - Proper indexes for performance optimization

### 2. Authentication System
- **Replaced API-based auth with Supabase direct integration**
  - Created `client/src/lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client configuration
  - Updated `client/src/hooks/useAuth.tsx` - Complete auth hook with:
    - User registration with role-based profile creation
    - Login with bcrypt password verification
    - Logout functionality
    - Session management via localStorage
    - Support for student, teacher, and parent roles

### 3. User Registration
- **Created comprehensive registration form** (`client/src/components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx`)
  - Role selection (Student, Teacher, Parent)
  - Dynamic form fields based on selected role
  - Password confirmation with validation
  - Phone number support
  - Grade selection for students
  - Relationship selection for parents
  - Full error handling and success feedback
- **Updated LoginForm** to include registration link

### 4. Frontend Updates
- **Updated Dashboard** (`client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)
  - Direct Supabase integration for stats
  - Real-time data fetching from database
  - User profile display
  - Role-specific welcome messages
  - Clean, functional UI with stats cards

### 5. Environment Configuration
- Created proper `.env` files with Supabase credentials
- Added Supabase JavaScript client library
- Installed required dependencies:
  - `@supabase/supabase-js`
  - `bcryptjs` (for password hashing)
  - `@types/bcryptjs`

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS enabled with policies for:
- Users can only view/edit their own data

4. Create a password (minimum 6 characters)
5. Submit to create your account

### Login
1. Enter your registered email
2. Enter your password
3. Click "Sign In"

### Available Roles
- **Student**: Access to learning materials, assignments, wellness tracking
- **Teacher**: Manage classes, create assignments, view student progress
- **Parent**: Monitor children's progress and wellness
- **Admin**: Full system access (requires database configuration)
- **Counselor**: Access to wellness and mental health data

## Next Steps for Development

1. **Apply Database Migration**
   - The migration file is ready at `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
   - Run this migration on your Supabase project
   - Use Supabase dashboard or CLI to apply

2. **Seed Initial Data**
   - Use the registration form to create your first users
   - Or run the seed script: `scripts/seed-database.ts`

3. **Additional Features to Implement**
   - Subject browsing and enrollment
   - Assignment submission system
   - Wellness check-in functionality
   - Real-time messaging
   - AI-powered recommendations
   - Analytics and progress tracking
